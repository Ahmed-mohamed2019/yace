Yet Another CPU Emulator
------------------------

YACE is CPU emulator library which is supposed to be pluggable. That is: instead of tightly coupling
system emulator and CPU emulator we attempt to create separate library which would be usable, e.g.,
to load x86-64 library into a RiscV-compiled application.
